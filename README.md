## ▶️ **How to Run the Project**

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CSE2792/DiseasePredictor.git
cd DiseasePredictor
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies (Python + Node)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

---

### 3️⃣ Start the Flask ML Backend

Open **Terminal 1** and run:

```bash
python app.py
```

This starts the ML prediction API at:

```
http://localhost:5000/
```

---

### 4️⃣ Start the Node.js Backend

Open **Terminal 2** and run:

```bash
node server.js
```

This starts the Node.js server (MongoDB + API + routing) at:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

---

### 5️⃣ Open the Frontend

Open:

```
frontwebpage.html
```

Your full system is now running:

```
Frontend → Node.js → Flask → ML Model
             |          
           MongoDB
```
